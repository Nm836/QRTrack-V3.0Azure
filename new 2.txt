Read thoroughly through files, I am uploading My Python file 'app.py' and my PHP file '6_StaffPage.php' I want to integrate QR code generator to 6_StaffPage.php page. I have table ///Login_Record (
            Student_StaffId INT PRIMARY KEY,
            FirstName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            LastName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            Phone BIGINT NOT NULL,
            Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            Type ENUM('Student', 'Staff') NOT NULL,
            Password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        )/// 
		and 
		////Student_Attendance_Record (
			StudentId INT not null,
			Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            SubCode INT NOT NULL,
			LectureWeek INT NOT NULL,
			AttendanceNum ENUM('Present','New'),
			LastEmailSent DATETIME null,
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentId) REFERENCES Login_Record(Student_StaffId)
			)///
			to store data generated after marking attendance.
			Narrate me the step by step process to integrate both the files, including the depencies and run my application.
